                 Native XDS-x86 Linux edition
                 ----------------------------
                            v2.60

                        Read Me First!


1. Installation
---------------

Under Unix, your XDS package is usually installed into the directory
"/usr/local/xds".  The location is not "hard-wired" into the executables,
so you are free to move the executables to other directories. These
notes assume the default setup.

After installation, edit your path environment variable to append path
to the "/usr/local/xds/bin" directory.

Example bash syntax:

    export XDSDIR=/usr/local/xds
    export PATH=$PATH:$XDSDIR/bin


1.1. Directory Structure
------------------------

The following directory structure is created during installation:

xds/
    bin             executable and system files
    C/
        C           library source code
    def/            definition modules:
        iso             ISO Modula-2 library
        ob2             Oberon-2 library pseudo-definition modules
        pim             PIM library
        POSIX           POSIX API
        ts              TopSpeed-like library
        X11             X11 API
        xds             XDS library
        Xm              Motif API
    doc             documentation (HTML)
    include/         
        x86         Native XDS-x86 library include files
    lib/            
        x86         Native XDS-x86 libraries
    licenses        license agreements
    pdf             printable documentation (PDF)
    readme          useful texts
    samples         Modula-2/Oberon-2 code samples
    sym/            
        x86         Native XDS-x86 symbol files


1.2. Building the library
-------------------------

The Native XDS-x86 runtime library was built on top of glibc 2 and
thus executables created by this product require glibc 2 shared
libraries unless you force static linking of C libraries:

    -usestaticclibs:+

The runtime library may have to be rebuilt on Linux systems that
use C library other than glibc 2.

To build the library, issue the following commands:

    cd /usr/local/xds/lib/x86
    rm libxds.a libts.a
    make -f lib.mkf
    make -f tslib.mkf


1.3. Building API symbol files
------------------------------

Your XDS package contains definition modules for POSIX and X11/Motif
APIs. To build the respective symbol files, issue the following
commands:

    cd /usr/local/xds
    ./apisyms-x86
     

2. Creating the Working Directory
---------------------------------

The "xcwork" shell script (/usr/local/xds/bin/xcwork) may
help you to create the working directory structure for your
project, for example

    mkdir wrk
    cd wrk
    xcwork


3. Creating X11/Motif applications
----------------------------------

If your program is an X11 application, turn the XAPP option ON
in the project file or in the command line:

    +xapp

If your program is a Motif application, turn the XMAPP option ON
in the project file or in the command line:

    +xmapp
